Java is an object-oriented programming language. The core concept of the object-oriented approach
is to break complex problems into smaller objects.

An object is any entity that has a state and behavior. For example, a bicycle is an object. It has

States: idle, first gear, etc
Behaviors: braking, accelerating, etc.



Java Class
A class is a blueprint for the object. Before we create an object, we first need to define the class.

We can think of the class as a prototype of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.

Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.


class ClassName {
  // fields-->fields are used to store data
  // methods-->methods are used to perform some operations
}



modifier static returnType nameOfMethod (parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // method body
}


Java Methods

A method is a block of code that performs a specific task.
Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes your program easy to understand and reusable.



static - If we use the static keyword, it can be accessed without creating objects.

For example, the sqrt() method of standard Math class is static. Hence, we can directly call
Math.sqrt() without creating an instance of Math class.
